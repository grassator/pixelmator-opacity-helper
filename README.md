# What is this?

I love [Pixelmator](http://pixelmator.com) but found it highly frustrating that I can't use number keys on my keyboard to control brush opacity like it can be done in Photoshop or [Acorn](http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/). So I wrote this little app to fix that.

## Installation

[github]:https://github.com/grassator/pixelmator-opacity-helper/releases/

Download the latest version from [releases page][github]. Unzip it and put in Applications folder on your Mac. To open use right click (Ctrl + click). On first launch you may be presented with a dialog box requesting Accessibility API access.

### Why does the app need Accessibility API access?

Unfortunately [Pixelmator](http://pixelmator.com) doesn't provide any kind of scripting API which leaves only Accessibility API interaction to adjust opacity sliders.
